# What's this

Just a simple tic-tac-toe game in javascript. The only goal is to have some fun and improve my javascript skills :-).

# What's next

1. Finish the game (for a start)
2. Improve the logic (continue with the array approach, or go for a matrix ?)
3. Improve the performance (maybe extend the .prototype only once, better loops, drier code)
4. Improve the AI (implement "strategies")
